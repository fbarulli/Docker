# Detailed Docker File Explanations

## Dockerfile

```FROM python:3.10-alpine```
- Uses the official Python 3.10 image with Alpine Linux as the base, which is lightweight and minimal

```COPY requirements.txt .```
- Copies the requirements.txt file from the local directory to the current directory in the container

```RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt --progress-bar off```
- Installs Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt
- `--no-cache-dir` prevents caching pip downloads to keep the image smaller
- `--progress-bar off` suppresses progress output during installation

```WORKDIR /app```
- Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`

```ARG TEST_FILE```
- Defines a build-time variable `TEST_FILE` that will be passed when building the image

```COPY ${TEST_FILE} test.py```
- Copies the file specified by the `TEST_FILE` argument to `test.py` in the container
- This allows using the same Dockerfile for different test files

```CMD ["python", "test.py"]```
- Specifies the default command to run when the container starts
- Executes the Python test script

## Dockerfile.base

```FROM python:3.10-alpine```
- Uses the lightweight Python 3.10 Alpine image as the base

```RUN pip install --no-cache-dir requests==2.28.1 --progress-bar off```
- Installs the specific version (2.28.1) of the requests library
- Uses the same flags as in the main Dockerfile to minimize image size and output

## docker-compose.yml

```services:```
- Defines the start of the services section where all container configurations are specified

```api:```
- Defines the configuration for the API service container

```image: datascientest/fastapi:1.0.0```
- Specifies the pre-built image to use for the API service

```container_name: api```
- Assigns a fixed name to the container for easier reference

```ports:```
- Defines port mappings between host and container

```- "8000:8000"```
- Maps port 8000 on the host to port 8000 in the container
- Allows accessing the API from the host machine at localhost:8000

```networks:```
- Specifies which networks the container should join

```- test-network```
- Connects the container to the "test-network" bridge network

```auth-test:```
- Defines the configuration for the authentication test service

```build:```
- Specifies how to build this service's image

```context: .```
- Sets the build context to the current directory

```args:```
- Defines build arguments to pass to the Dockerfile

```TEST_FILE: auth_test.py```
- Sets the TEST_FILE argument to auth_test.py

```volumes:```
- Defines volume mappings between host and container

```- log-volume:/app/logs```
- Mounts the named volume "log-volume" to /app/logs in the container
- Used for persistent storage of log files

```- ./requirements.txt:/app/requirements.txt```
- Mounts the local requirements.txt file to the container
- Allows updating requirements without rebuilding the image

```environment:```
- Sets environment variables for the container

```- LOG=1```
- Sets the LOG environment variable to 1, enabling logging

```depends_on:```
- Specifies dependency order for container startup

```- api```
- Ensures the API container starts before this test container

```networks:```
- Connects this container to the same network as the API

```- test-network```
- Ensures all containers can communicate with each other

```command: ["python", "test.py"]```
- Overrides the default command specified in the Dockerfile

[Similar configurations for authz-test and content-test services]

```networks:```
- Defines the networks to be created

```test-network:```
- Configuration for the test network

```driver: bridge```
- Uses the standard bridge network driver

```volumes:```
- Defines named volumes to be created

```log-volume:```
- Creates a named volume for storing logs
- No specific driver or options specified, uses defaults
